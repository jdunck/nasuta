Nasuta is a collection of data structures you've wished were in the language.  

(So far it's just an Range with some rich methods for comparison, including contains, overlaps, abuts.  Range can be bounded or unbounded, over contiuuous or discrete elements.)

Nasuta is partially inspired by Martin Fowler's Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture, and Range is taken directly from it.

Docs soon, but see the unit tests for now.

Python 2.7, 3.4, and 3.5 are supported, as well as pypy2 and pypy3.
